# Information for Contributors

Contributions in the form of pull requests, issue reports, and feature requests are welcome!

## Submitting a PR

- [ ] Fork the [esp-protocols repository on GitHub](https://github.com/espressif/esp-protocols) to start making your changes.

- [ ] Install pre-commit hooks: `pip install pre-commit && pre-commit install`

- [ ] Send a pull request (PR) and work with us until it gets merged and published. Contributions may need some modifications, so a few rounds of review and fixing may be necessary.

For quick merging, the contribution should be short, and concentrated on a single feature or topic. The larger the contribution is, the longer it would take to review it and merge it.
