2.   Requirements
2.1.   Building the boost thread library
3.   Building on Linux
4.   Building on Win32
4.1.   Building with MSVC

1. Supported Platforms
======================

The asio library has been built and tested on the following compiler/platform
combinations:

  - Redhat Linux 7.3 using gcc 2.95.3
  - Redhat Linux 7.3 using gcc 3.2.1
  - Microsoft Windows 2000 using MSVC 6 sp5
  - Microsoft Windows 2000 using Borland C++ Builder 6 patch 4 (bcc32 5.6.4)


2. Requirements
===============

The asio library requires boost version 1.30.0, with the threading library
built.

2.1. Building the boost thread library

This is intended as a quick guide to building the boost thread library for your
compiler/platform combination. Please consult the boost documentation for a
more detailed description.

If you are using gcc on Linux:

- Change directory to `boost_1_30_0/tools/build/jam_src'.

- Run `./build.sh'.

- Change directory to `boost_1_30_0/libs/thread/build'.

- Run `../../../tools/build/jam_src/bin.linuxx86/bjam -sTOOLS=gcc'.

- Add the `boost_1_30_0/libs/thread/build/bin-stage' directory to your
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable before running any executables which
  make use of the library.

If you are using MSVC on Windows 2000:

- Change directory to `boost_1_30_0\tools\build\jam_src'.

- Run `build.bat'.

- Change directory to `boost_1_30_0\libs\thread\build'.

- Run `..\..\..\tools\build\jam_src\bin.ntx86\bjam -sTOOLS=msvc'.

- Add the `boost_1_30_0\libs\thread\build\bin-stage' directory to your PATH
  environment variable before running any executables which make use of the
  library.

If you are using Borland C++ on Windows 2000:

- Change directory to `boost_1_30_0\tools\build\jam_src'.

- Run `build.bat'.

- Change directory to `boost_1_30_0\libs\thread\build'.

- Run `..\..\..\tools\build\jam_src\bin.ntx86\bjam -sTOOLS=borland'.

- Add the `boost_1_30_0\libs\thread\build\bin-stage' directory to your PATH
  environment variable before running any executables which make use of the
  library.


3. Building on Linux
====================

If the boost directory (i.e. the directory called boost_1_30_0) is in the same
directory as the asio source kit, then you may configure asio by simply going:

  ./configure

in the root directory of the asio source kit. If the boost directory is in some
other location, then you need to specify this directory when running configure:

  ./configure --with-boost=<BOOSTDIR>

When specifying the boost directory in this way you should ensure that you use
an absolute path.

To build, simply run `make' in the root directory of the asio source kit.


4. Building on Win32
====================

To build with either of the supported Win32 compilers, the boost directory
(i.e. the directory called boost_1_30_0) must be in the same directory as the
one that contains the asio source kit.

4.1. Building with MSVC

To build using the MSVC 6 command line compiler, perform the following steps:

  - Change to the asio `src' directory.

  - Execute the command `nmake -f Makefile.msc'.

4.2. Building with Borland C++

To build using the Borland C++ Builder 6 command line compiler, perform the
following steps:

  - Change to the asio `src' directory.

  - Execute the command `make -f Makefile.bor'.
