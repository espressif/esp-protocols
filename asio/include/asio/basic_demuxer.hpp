/**
 * The basic_demuxer class template provides the core event demultiplexing
 * functionality for users of the asynchronous I/O objects, including:
 *
 * @li asio::stream_socket
 * @li asio::datagram_socket
 * @li asio::socket_acceptor
 * @li asio::deadline_timer.
 *
 * The basic_demuxer class template also includes facilities intended for
 * developers of custom asynchronous services.
 *
 * Most applications will use the asio::demuxer typedef.
 *
 * @par Thread Safety:
 * @e Distinct @e objects: Safe.@n
 * @e Shared @e objects: Safe, with the exception that calling reset()
 * while there are unfinished run() calls results in undefined behaviour.
 *
 * @par Concepts:
 * Dispatcher.
