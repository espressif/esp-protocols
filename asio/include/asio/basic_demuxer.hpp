 * The basic_demuxer class template provides the core event demultiplexing
 * functionality for users of the asynchronous I/O objects, including
 * asio::stream_socket, asio::datagram_socket, asio::socket_acceptor and
 * asio::deadline_timer. The basic_demuxer class template also includes
 * facilities intended for developers of custom asynchronous services.
 *
 * Most applications will use the asio::demuxer typedef.
 *
 * @par Thread Safety:
 * @e Distinct @e objects: Safe.@n
 * @e Shared @e objects: Safe, with the exception that calling reset()
 * while there are unfinished run() calls results in undefined behaviour.
 *
 * @par Concepts:
 * Dispatcher.
