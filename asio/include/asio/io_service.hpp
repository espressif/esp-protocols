/// Provides core I/O functionality.
/**
 * The io_service class provides the core I/O functionality for users of the
 * asynchronous I/O objects, including:
 *
 * @li asio::ip::tcp::socket
 * @li asio::ip::tcp::acceptor
 * @li asio::ip::udp::socket
 * @li asio::deadline_timer.
 *
 * The io_service class also includes facilities intended for developers of
 * custom asynchronous services.
 *
 * @par Thread Safety
 * @e Distinct @e objects: Safe.@n
 * @e Shared @e objects: Safe, with the exception that calling reset()
 * while there are unfinished run() calls results in undefined behaviour.
 *
 * @par Concepts:
 * Dispatcher.
 *
 * @par Effect of exceptions thrown from handlers
 *
 * If an exception is thrown from a handler, the exception is allowed to
 * propagate through the throwing thread's invocation of
 * asio::io_service::run(), asio::io_service::run_one(),
 * asio::io_service::poll() or asio::io_service::poll_one().
 * No other threads that are calling any of these functions are affected. It is
 * then the responsibility of the application to catch the exception.
 *
 * After the exception has been caught, the
 * asio::io_service::run(), asio::io_service::run_one(),
 * asio::io_service::poll() or asio::io_service::poll_one()
 * call may be restarted @em without the need for an intervening call to
 * asio::io_service::reset(). This allows the thread to rejoin the
 * io_service's thread pool without impacting any other threads in the pool.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * @code
 * asio::io_service io_service;
 * ...
 * for (;;)
 * {
 *   try
 *   {
 *     io_service.run();
 *     break; // run() exited normally
 *   }
 *   catch (my_exception& e)
 *   {
 *     // Deal with exception as appropriate.
 *   }
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * @par Stopping the io_service from running out of work
 *
 * Some applications may need to prevent an io_service's run() call from
 * returning when there is no more work to do. For example, the io_service may
 * be being run in a background thread that is launched prior to the
 * application's asynchronous operations. The run() call may be kept running by
 * creating an object of type asio::io_service::work:
 *
 * @code asio::io_service io_service;
 * asio::io_service::work work(io_service);
 * ... @endcode
 *
 * To effect a shutdown, the application will then need to call the io_service's
 * stop() member function. This will cause the io_service run() call to return
 * as soon as possible, abandoning unfinished operations and without permitting
 * ready handlers to be dispatched.
 *
 * Alternatively, if the application requires that all operations and handlers
 * be allowed to finish normally, the work object may be explicitly destroyed.
 *
 * @code asio::io_service io_service;
 * auto_ptr<asio::io_service::work> work(
 *     new asio::io_service::work(io_service));
 * ...
 * work.reset(); // Allow run() to exit. @endcode
