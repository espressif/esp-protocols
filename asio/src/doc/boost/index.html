    <p>
      Boost.Asio is a cross-platform C++ library for network programming that
      provides developers with a consistent asynchronous I/O model using a
      modern C++ approach.
    </p>

    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
    <p>
      The <a href="tutorial/index.html">tutorial</a> introduces the fundamental
      concepts required to use Boost.Asio, and shows how to use Boost.Asio to
      develop simple client and server programs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <a href="examples/index.html">annotated examples</a> illustrate the
      use of Boost.Asio in more complex applications.
    </p>

    <h2>Dependencies</h2>
    <p>
      There is no need to build any of the Boost libraries to use Boost.Asio, as
      only the header files are required. (Note: with MSVC or Borland C++ you
      may need to add -DBOOST_DATE_TIME_NO_LIB to your project settings to
      disable autolinking of the Boost.Date_Time library.)
    </p>
    <p>
      To use the SSL support, <a href="http://www.openssl.org">OpenSSL</a> is
      required. OpenSSL is not necessary to use the rest of Boost.Asio.
    </p>

    <h2>Supported Platforms</h2>
    <p>
      The following platforms and compilers have been tested:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Win32 using Visual C++ 7.1 and Visual C++ 8.0.
        </li>
        <li>
          Win32 using Borland C++Builder 6 patch 4.
        </li>
        <li>
          Win32 using MinGW.
        </li>
        <li>
          Linux (2.4 or 2.6 kernels) using g++ 3.3 or later.
        </li>
        <li>
          Solaris using g++ 3.3 or later.
        </li>
        <li>
          Mac OS X 10.4 using g++ 3.3 or later.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Rationale</h2>
    <p>
      The Boost.Asio library is intended for programmers using C++ for systems
      programming, where access to operating system functionality such as
      networking is often required. In particular, Boost.Asio attempts to
      address the following goals:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Portability.</b> The library should support, and provide consistent
          behaviour across, a range of commonly used operating systems.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Scalability.</b> The library should allow, and indeed encourage,
          the development of network applications that scale to hundreds or
          thousands of concurrent connections. The library implementation for
          each operating system should use the mechanism that best enables this
          scalability.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Efficiency.</b> The library should support techniques such as
          scatter-gather I/O, and allow protocol implementations that minimise
          data copying.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Model Berkeley sockets.</b> The Berkeley sockets API is widely
          implemented and understood, as well as being covered in much
          literature. Other programming languages often use a similar interface
          for networking APIs.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Ease of use.</b> Lower the entry barrier for new users by taking a
          toolkit, rather than framework, approach. That is, try to minimise
          the up-front investment in time to just learning a few basic rules and
          guidelines. After that, a library user should only need to understand
          the specific functions that are being used.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Basis for further abstraction.</b> The library should permit the
          development of other libraries that provide higher levels of
          abstraction. For example, implementations of commonly used protocols
          such as HTTP.
        </li>
      </ul>
      Although the current incarnation of Boost.Asio focuses primarily on
      networking, its concepts of asynchronous I/O can be extended to include
      other operating system resources such as files.
