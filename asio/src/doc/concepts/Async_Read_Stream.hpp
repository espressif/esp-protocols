   * This function is used to asynchronously read one or more bytes of data from
   * the stream. The function call always returns immediately.
   *
   * @param buffers The buffers into which the data will be read. Although the
   * buffers object may be copied as necessary, ownership of the underlying
   * buffers is retained by the caller, which must guarantee that they remain
   * valid until the handler is called.
   *
   * @param handler The handler to be called when the read operation completes.
   * Copies will be made of the handler as required. The equivalent function
   * signature of the handler must be:
   * @code void handler(
   *   const Async_Read_Stream::error_type& error, // Result of operation.
   *   std::size_t bytes_transferred               // Number of bytes read.
   * ); @endcode
