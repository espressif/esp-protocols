   * This function is used to asynchronously write one or more bytes of data to
   * the stream. The function call always returns immediately.
   *
   * @param buffers The data to be written to the stream. Although the buffers
   * object may be copied as necessary, ownership of the underlying buffers is
   * retained by the caller, which must guarantee that they remain valid until
   * the handler is called.
   *
   * @param handler The handler to be called when the write operation completes.
   * Copies will be made of the handler as required. The equivalent function
   * signature of the handler must be:
   * @code void handler(
   *   const Async_Write_Stream::error_type& error, // Result of operation.
   *   std::size_t bytes_transferred                // Number of bytes written.
   * ); @endcode
   * Regardless of whether the asynchronous operation completes immediately or
   * not, the handler will not be invoked from within this function. Invocation
   * of the handler will be performed in a manner equivalent to using
   * asio::demuxer::post().
