    config ESP_MODEM_CMUX_DEFRAGMENT_PAYLOAD
        bool "Defragment CMUX messages internally"
        default y
        help
            If enabled (default), the esp-modem automatically defragments CMUX messages
            to only pass the completed CMUX message to higher layers.
            This is useful for messages in command mode (if they're received fragmented).
            It's not a problem for messages in data mode as the upper layer (PPP protocol)
            defines message boundaries.
            Keep the default to true for most cases (as most devices use simply 1 byte CMUX
            length, as the internal Rx buffer of size >= 256 bytes won't overflow)
            Set to false if your devices uses 2 byte CMUX payload (e.g. A7672S).
            The operation would work without an issue in data mode, but some replies
            in command mode might come fragmented in rare cases so might need to retry
            AT commands.

    config ESP_MODEM_USE_INFLATABLE_BUFFER_IF_NEEDED
        bool "Use inflatable buffer in DCE"
        default n
        help
            If enabled we will process the ongoing AT command by growing the current
            buffer (if we've run out the preconfigured buffer).
            If disabled, we simply report a failure.
            Use this if additional allocation is not a problem and you need to reliably process
            all commands, usually with sporadically longer responses than the configured buffer.
            Could be also used to defragment AT replies in CMUX mode if CMUX_DEFRAGMENT_PAYLOAD=n

    config ESP_MODEM_CMUX_DELAY_AFTER_DLCI_SETUP
        int "Delay in ms to wait before creating another virtual terminal"
        default 0
        help
            Some devices might need a pause before sending SABM command that creates
            virtual terminal. This delay applies only to establishing a CMUX mode.
            The typical reason for failing SABM request without a delay is that
            some devices (SIM800) send MSC requests just after opening a new DLCI.
